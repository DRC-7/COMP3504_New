Assignment 2 - COMP3504: Programming IV: Software Engineering

## Task
Create a mobile app that allows the user to:

- Navigate through different screens on the app.
- View a list of cryptocurrency and their prices.
- View detailed information about a cryptocurrency.
- Add a cryptocurrency to their "Favourites."

## Challenge 
Work through the software development lifecycle to create a mobile application:

- Requirements gather from the customer (classmate).
- Designing the application using information gathered from lo-fi prototypes.
- Developing the application for a mobile phone.
- Testing/demoing the application to the customer.

This application was created using an Agile approach with a lot of user involvement (asking classmate stakeholders 2x per week)

## Technologies Used
- Expo.io (allows for the application to be run on a phone)
- React

## Limitation
There is no backend functionality, all of the data is hardcoded.
